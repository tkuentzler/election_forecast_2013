# election_forecast_2013
Those are the replication files for my published paper on forecasting the German national elections in 2013 (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644008.2017.1280781).

The webscrpaing of wahlrecht.org was performed by Simon Munzert, which is why this code is not shown here. You have acces to the resulting data, though.

Please be kind on judging coding style since parts of this code stem from my very early R projects many years ago, so no tidyverse or dplyer. I'm not even sure tidyverse existed at the time of writing the code.
